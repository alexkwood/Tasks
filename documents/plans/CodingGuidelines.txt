Ramp Up:
- Learn about Buildfiles
- Learn about RunLoops
- Learn about views/mixins/ContentDisplay mixin
- Read view.js/tab.js/collection.js & learn about Responders
- Read runtime/mixins/observable.js, system/bindings.js, event.js
- Learn how to use mixins/enumerable.js reducers


Guidelines:
- Kill all sc_require('core'); statements - they are gratuitous
- Access controllers directly, not via get() calls - they are just namespaces, not properties
- Ensure @scope & @extend for all files (understand what these are for)
- Named hashes are strange in SC - find other ways instead
- Don't call out literals outside of the create() method
- Stick to SC coding conventions, use SC doc tags
- Don't put view properties or actions in controllers
- Ensure bindings are of the form 'Namespace.Object.Property'
- Always return YES from mouseDown()
- Implement hotkeys as ctrl_shift_a() { ... }
- Use setClass() instead of addClass() - former more efficient (won't change if not needed)
- Ensure layouts always have 4 properties
- Use firstTime attribute of render() to be more efficient
- Don't get('content') from controllers (e.g., as in exportData)
- Minimize use of .observes()


Tips:
- Set SC.LOG_BINDINGS to YES to troubleshoot
- Use SC.Benchmark.start(key) & end(key) to profile/tune code

  Before deploying add this line to the top of Buildfile:
		config :all, :url_prefix => "/Tasks/static"
	To build and deploy:
	  A) Create a directory at the same level as "tasks" named "tasks-builds"
    B) Change into "tasks" directory and type "sc-build -rc tasks --build=build"
    C) When the build finishes run the following commands the directory above "tasks":
         1. cp -r tasks/tmp/build/Tasks/static tasks-builds/.
         2. cd tasks && git checkout gh-pages
         3. cp -r ../tasks-builds/static .
         4. cp static/tasks/en/build/index.html .
         5. git add . && git commit -avm "new build"
         6. git push origin gh-pages

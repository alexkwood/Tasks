	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p class="softwareOnly" style="margin-left: 5px"><app>tasks</app> is an Agile project management tool (a Scrum <i>Task Board</i>) to help teams keep up with the chaos of software development. Managers like this tool since it allows them to plan projects and track their execution.  Developers embrace this tool since it is lightweight and focuses them on coding assignments. Testers enjoy the instant visibility into completed tasks and the convenience of one-click validation.<p>
		<p style="margin-left: 5px">A <i>task</i> is something a <i>user</i> does and tasks are grouped into <i>project</i>s.  A user <i>submits</i> (or creates) tasks and these are <i>assigned</i> to users.  Sets of tasks are <i>allocated</i> to a project (an "initiative" or a "release").</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 5px"><app>tasks</app> is a rich client providing desktop application capabilities such as drag-and-drop manipulation, right-click context menus, and type-ahead searches.  As you make changes in the application they are automatically saved to the server (unless you prefer to save manually by disabling "AutoSave" via the actions menu).</p>
	<h2>Basic Features</h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 5px">As soon as you understand a few basic concepts you can start using <app>tasks</app>. More powerful features use <i>progressive disclosure</i> so that you can gradually expand your sphere of comfort. <app>tasks</app> enforces role-based access control: only Managers can add/edit/delete projects while Guests can only add unallocated tasks and edit/delete tasks they submitted).</p>
		<h3>Projects</h3>
			<p>To begin, click on the plus button beneath the projects list to create a project and type in its name. To view a project's tasks, simply click on the project name.  To rename a project double click on its name and change it (if the project is already selected, you just have to click on it again to start editing it).  To delete a project select it and then click on the minus button beneath the projects list.  There are "system projects"SYSTEM PROJECTS"" at the top of the projects list to show all, unallocated, and unassigned tasks respectively. As you work on your projects, you can mark them as "Active" via the popup editor or context menu.  When all tasks for a project are completed, you can mark it as "Done" and it won't clutter the projects list.</p>
			<p class="softwareOnly">Your iterative releases naturally map to <app>tasks</app> projects. For example, if you use Rational Unified Process (RUP) or eXtreme Unified Process (XUP), your timeboxed <i>SmallReleases</i> become projects like "Architectural Baseline" and "FeatureReleaseOne."  Those using Scrum should use projects to map out their <i>Sprints</i> and <i>Backlog</i>.</p>
		<h3>Tasks</h3>
			<p>To create a task, click on the plus button beneath the tasks list button and enter the name and other attributes of the task via the popup editor.  If you have a project selected, the new task is automatically allocated to that project.  If you have a task selected, the new task is automatically assigned to the same user and copies over some of the selected task's attributes.  Update a task's name by double clicking on it and using the inline editor.  To add more comprehensive task description use the popup editor.  Set the task's attributes via context menus or the popup/inline editors.  Delete selected tasks using the minus button beneath the tasks list.  To reassign a task to another user, simply drag-and-drop it to the target user if they are visible or use the task popup editor to change the assignee.  To reallocate a task to another project drag-and-drop it on the target project in the master list or via the task popup editor.  You can navigate to previous/next tasks via the popup editor using the arrow buttons at the bottom.  Note: you can select multiple tasks at once and perform attribute change and delete/reassign/reallocate operations.  Tasks are grouped by assignee and task attributes are displayed as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<span class="softwareOnly"><li>icons indicate <i>type</i></li></span>
				<li>fonts indicate <i>priority</i></li>
				<li>text color indicates <i>status</i></li>
				<span class="softwareOnly"><li>ID background color indicates <i>validation</i></li></span>
			</ul>
		<p class="softwareOnly">When entering a task, use the XP principle of <i>FeaturesNotSubsystems</i> - try to build user-visible <i>Features</i> that may need some <i>Other</i> tasks as infrastructure.  XP's <i>RefactorMericilessly</i> manifests itself as <i>Bug</i> and <i>Other</i> tasks - pay off your technical debt as you go.
		<h3 class="softwareOnly">Workflow</h3>
			<p class="softwareOnly">Plan your tasks, specifying the <i>type</i> and <i>priority</i> for each. Allocate tasks to projects and assign them to team members.  Then work on your tasks, noting your <i>status</i> as you go. Finally, if needed, indicate the <i>validation</i> of completed tasks.</p
	 	<h3>Sorting</h3>
			<p>Sorting in <app>tasks</app> is automatic. Projects and Users are sorted alphabetically. Tasks are sorted by their attributes as well as alphabetically or by index (if task name starts with a number).  This helps you focus on what you are working on now and what is next.</p>
		<h3>Shortcuts</h3>
			<p>Hot keys are available for a couple of common actions: New Task = Control-Equals and Duplicate Task = Control-Shift-Plus.  Right clicking on projects and tasks provides a context menu with common actions.</p>
		<h3>Recently Updated Items</h3>
			<p>Projects/Tasks/Users that were created or updated within the last day are prefixed with a dot.</p>
	<h2>Intermediate Features</h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 5px">Now you are ready to graduate to the next level of <app>tasks</app> features.</p>
	<h3>Filtering</h3>
			<p>You can control which tasks are displayed via filtering, using one or more of three approaches:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Specify one or more task [assignees] or &lt;submitters&gt; (comma or space separated).  You must type in the exact login name or a part of the full name (case sensitive).</li>
				<li>Search for one or more task IDs (each prepended by '#' and comma or space separated) or a string matching any part of task <i>name</i> or <i>description</i> in the search bar (prefix with a caret to find items that don't match the search pattern).</li>
				<li>Click on the "Filter" button and use the <i>QuickFilters</i> at the top of the filter panel.  You may get even more selective by manually controlling the checkboxes for the various attributes. You may also filter tasks that were recently updated, have effort specified, or are being watched.  Whether an attribute filter is on or off is indicated by a traffic lighted "Filter" icon.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Filtering results are displayed as soon as you stop typing in the assignee or search text boxes.</p>
		<h3>Clustering</h3>
			<p>Prefix names of related tasks with <i>Use Case</i> or <i>Component</i> names so that these tasks can be found by searching for that prefix.  This is a simple solution for task clustering avoiding the complications of nested (sub) tasks or tagging/tag management. You can use the Task "Duplicate" feature (available via a hot key and context menu) to create tasks with the same prefix.</p>
		<h3>Traceability</h3>
			<p><app>tasks</app> allows you to trace back to related artifacts via the task description by adding a link to an external Wiki page or Content Management System (CMS) artifact.  If you need attachments (like images) you must host them somewhere and link to them.  There is no support for inter-task dependencies/critical path analysis - you can simply reference the IDs of upstream tasks in the description.</p>
		<h3>Load Balancing</h3>
			<p>To use this feature, you must specify the <i>time left</i> in an active project and set the <i>effort</i> for tasks as integer or decimal numbers, optionally appended with an unit of 'd' (days) or 'h' (hours).  If no time unit is specified it is assumed to mean 'days.'  Task <i>effort</i> may also be expressed as a range like: '3-5d'.<app>tasks</app> will automatically total the efforts for each assignee (excluding <i>Low</i> priority tasks) and indicate their loading via color coding. A "?" is appended for range-based subtotals including tasks with unspecified efforts.</p>
			<p class="softwareOnly">To manage the release till <i>Feature Freeze</i> set the project's <i>time left</i> accordingly.  While the project is active <app>tasks</app> will decrement and display the <i>countdown</i> next to the project name every day until no time is left. As the team moves towards <i>Code Freeze</i>, you may reset the <i>activated at</i> field and <i>time left</i> to the number of days you allocate to code stabilization.  This way, the team can run very tight cycles and converge on the milestones of <i>Code/Feature Freezes.</i>
		<h3>Statistics</h3>
			<p>Choose "Statistics..." in the actions menu to get a popup dialog summarizing statistics about the displayed tasks.  This is quite useful in seeing how tasks are broken up by their attributes.</p>
	<h2>Advanced Features</h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 5px">Let's close out with some <app>tasks</app> power user features.</p>
		<h3>Watches and Email Notifications</h3>
			<p>You can also "Watch" or "Unwatch" sets of tasks via the context menu.  Tasks you are watching have their <i>IDs</i> underlined.  You can see who is watching a task from the task popup editor by clicking on the button at the bottom left (which is visible if there are any watchers).</p>
			<p><app>tasks</app> running with a Google App Engine server sends email notifications when Tasks are created/updated by someone other than the Submitter or Assignee.  To receive email notifications, you must specify a valid email address via the "Users/Settings" panel.  If you don't want notifications sent when you make changes, disable "Notications" via the actions menu.</p>
		<h3>Default Project</h3>
			<p><app>tasks</app> allows you to select your default project (which is selected at startup) and a search pattern, by specifying or bookmarking an URL like this (replace items in CAPS with your specifics):</p>
			<pre style="margin-left: 50px">http://HOST:PORT/tasks#select&amp;projectId=#ID&amp;search=SEARCH_PATTERN</pre>
			<p>When you click on any project, the URL is automatically set to a value in the format shown above so that you may bookmark that project and return to it easily.</p>
		<h3>Task Links</h3>
			<p>You can also view specific tasks using an URL like this (replace items in CAPS with your specifics) - this is useful for sending links to people via email (user is logged in automatically as 'guest'):</p>
			<pre style="margin-left: 50px">http://HOST:PORT/tasks#view&amp;search=#ID</pre>
		<h3>Clipboard Copy</h3>
			<p>You can copy the <i>ID</i> and <i>name</i> of selected tasks to the clipboard by clicking on the icon that appears in the top bar to the left of the filter button.  This is useful for code commit messages or to email people.</p>
		<h3>Data Exchange</h3>
			<p><app>tasks</app> allows data to be exchanged via a simple import/export mechanism.  Choose "Import" in the actions menu to bring data into the application.  Check the box at the bottom left of the Import panel to automatically create new users for unknown assignees/submitters found during importing.  Choose one of two "Export" options from the actions menu: (1) "Text"  is used to output <app>tasks</app> data to another installation of the application or some other system and (2) "HTML" is used to view the data as a Web page and to print it (especially if you have multiple pages worth of tasks).</p>
		<h3>Bulk Data Entry</h3>
			<p>Use the Import panel to type in a bunch of tasks at once - basically use it as a simple text editor.  You may use the rich syntax shown at the top of the import panel while performing bulk data entry if you prefer to type.</p>
		<h3>Inline Editing</h3>
			<p>Double click on a project and specify its <i>time left</i> as a number enclosed by curly braces. Double click on a task and specify its properties/attributes inline using the same syntax for Import/Export. Reassign a task to another user by typing in their login name within square brackets inline at the end of a task.</p>
		<h3>Configuration and Administration</h3>
			<p>Choose "Users/Settings" in the actions menu to manage users and preferences.  Here Managers can add/modify/delete users and their roles (via drag-and-drop too).  When a user is deleted, all task submitter and assignee fields referencing this user are cleared. You can find users by searching for name/loginName in the search bar at the top right.</p>
	<h2>Best Practices</h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 5px">To get the maximum value from using <app>tasks</app>, consider the following recommendations.</p>
		<h3>Clarify Tasks</h3>
			<p>Make each task SMART (<i>Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Resourced, Timebound</i>) ensuring that the task: (1) is self-explanatory, (2) has clear success criteria, (3) has realistic estimates which are refined as you proceed, (4) maps out dependencies, and (5) is broken into small chunks each taking no more than a day or two.</p>
		<h3>Baseline Plans</h3>
			<p>Export and set aside a snapshot of the tasks after people have committed to a plan. Before baselining, ensure there are no unassigned tasks, discuss/resolve all Risky tasks, ensure that no effort totals have a question mark in them (to indicate missing estimates), and load balance to avoid overloaded (red) assignees.</p>
			<p class="softwareOnly"><app>tasks</app> directly supports eXtreme Programming (XP) <i>PlanningGame</i> or Scrum <i>Sprint Planning Meeting</i>. See how you fared vs. the baselined plans during an XP <i>ProjectRetrospective</i> or Scrum <i>Sprint Review Meeting</i>.</p>
		<h3>Plan Long Term</h3>
			<p>Map out future work and background initiatives as projects - this allows you to plan ahead and provides a place to capture ideas and reallocate tasks that don't fit into current schedules.</p>
		<h3>Surface Risks</h3>
			<p>You should flag a task as <i>Risky</i> if the task has unresolved ambiguity, is blocked owing to other dependencies, blew up during execution and now may take significantly longer, and so on.  Add notes to the task description explaining why the task is at risk. This provides advance visibility to potential slippage or deviation ahead of time so corrective action can be taken. No problems are swept under the carpet. No one is penalized for recognizing or describing an unforeseen problem.</p>
		<h3>Manage by Exception</h3>
			<p>In the team summary display mode, a red flag next to an Assignee name indicates that they have Risky or Failed tasks. Assignees are sorted in descending order of loading/red flags.  You can drill into the tasks for any Asignee simply by clicking on them.  This focuses attention to Assignees who are most at risk of not completing on time.</p>
			<p class="softwareOnly">At regular Scrum huddles <app>tasks</app> helps to review risks/discuss mitigations, monitor progress, and load balance remaining work across team members (XP's <i>CollectiveCodeOwnership</i> helps with distributing work).</p>
		<h3>Collaborate Online</h3>
			<p>Use the task <i>submitter</i> to indicate your <i>collaborator</i> - the person you will consult with as you work on this task.  Add tasks for people instead of walking up and interrupting them - they can review your requested tasks at their leisure and decide when to address them.  As you have ideas or notice defects, add tasks to capture them.</p>
		<h3>Chunk Up Work</h3>
			<p>For interrupt-driven tasks such as leadership or support, you should block out the anticipated amount of time when the project is being planned and the tasks being load balanced.  As you work on these interrupt-driven tasks, use the Task "Duplicate" feature (available via a hot key and context menu) to split up the task and enter the details and effort you just expended and subtract that effort from the original Task (so it now will show what is left to do). Also, if you are almost finished with a task and have a small final portion left, split up the task and mark the completed portion <i>Done</i>.  In both cases, splitting up tasks will help you avoid the dreaded <i>overloaded</i> assignee moniker!</p>
			<p><app>tasks</app>  doesn't preserve the original estimates and support partial time logging - it is flexible and allows a task to have no estimate at the start, refined to a range estimate, and finalized to an actual at the end.</p>
		<h3 class="softwareOnly">Capture Release Notes</h3>
			<p class="softwareOnly">As you finish a task, document its Release Notes in real time (what works, what doesn't, limitations, et al).  This is a very effective way for Developers to document what Testers need to know when they validate completed tasks.</p>
		<h3 class="softwareOnly">Ensure Independent Acceptance</h3>
			<p class="softwareOnly">Ideally your <i>OnsiteCustomer</i> can test and accept completed work, providing invaluable feedback.  In general, it is best to have someone other than the assignee verify completed tasks, to ensure quality.</p>
		<h3 class="softwareOnly">Plan End Game</h3>
			<p class="softwareOnly">As you <i>CountDownToRelease</i> use <i>QuickFilters</i> to view and resolve showstoppers.  This is a particularly good time to take advantage of the load balancing capabilities of <app>tasks</app> and <i>Productionize</i> your code as quickly as possible.</p>
		<h3>Use Templates</h3>
			<p>You can create project/task <i>templates</i> by exporting data and bringing them back in via import.  This is particularly useful when you have a boilerplate set of items you reuse as you start initiatives. You can create the template data outside of <app>tasks</app> as well.  Templated data gives you a jump start after which you can add/modify/delete items at will.</p>
	<h2>Reference</h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 5px">This section provides details about the various entities used in <app>tasks</app>.</p>
		<h3>Task</h3>
			<p>An atomic unit of work with several attributes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i>name</i>: one-line summary describing the task; you may want to name related tasks with a common prefix followed by a colon</li>
